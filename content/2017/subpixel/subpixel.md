The idea of subpixel convolution was originally proposed by [W. Shi et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05158)
from [Magic
Pony](https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/20/twitter-is-buying-magic-pony-technology-which-uses-neural-networks-to-improve-images/),
and well explained in [this
post](http://www.inference.vc/holiday-special-deriving-the-subpixel-cnn-from-first-principles/).
The figure below illustrates in 1-dimensional case that subpixel
convolution is probably just transposed convolution (or deconvolution).
