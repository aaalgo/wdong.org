The idea of subpixel convolution was originally proposed by W. Shi et
al, and well explained in [this
post](http://www.inference.vc/holiday-special-deriving-the-subpixel-cnn-from-first-principles/).
The figure below illustrates in 1-dimensional case that subpixel
convolution is probably just transposed convolution (or deconvolution).
