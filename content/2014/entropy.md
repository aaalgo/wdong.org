Never realized the relationship between the two until we came up with a fancy convex programming formulization with entropy regulation to solve a recommendation problem and obtained the well-known simple formula with softmax.  Google'd the keywords and didn't see a clear explanation within the first few pages of search results, so I guess it might be helpful to write down a summary of the connection.
